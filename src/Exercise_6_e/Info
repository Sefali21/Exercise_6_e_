Abstract the concept of Coin with a class (complete with comments).
We assume that all the coins will have the EURO as the currency, and will have the encapsulated value variable.
Does it make sense to create a coin without specifying its value?
Create a constraint so that coins must be instantiated with a value.

It is convenient to print a sentence in every important method
to be able to verify the successful execution of our code.
For example, when a currency is instantiated.
